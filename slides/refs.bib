  abstract         = {Understanding the interaction of terrestrial freshwater and seawater in the subterranean estuary (STE) is an important factor when considering nutrient fluxes from land to sea. State-of-the-art research describes the STE by a tide-induced upper saline recirculation cell, a freshwater discharge tube and a deep saltwater wedge. However, recent numerical modelling and shallow hydrogeochemical investigations for high-energy beaches indicate that multiple saline recirculation cells may exist and affect the land-sea interaction. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Direct Push (DP) technologies are common tools to explore the subsurface. Due to their sensitivity to the electrical conductivity of pore water, they permit investigating the STE. This study combines ERT and DP to image the salinity distribution within the STE of a meso-tidal, high-energy beach. We actively incorporate the DP data into the ERT inversion and use geostatistical regularization for closing the resolution gap. For the first time, our experimental results confirm the existence of several 10–20 m deep reaching upper saline recirculation cells and corresponding brackish discharge locations generated by a pronounced runnel-ridge beach system in 2019, whereas in 2021 only a single cell was displayed for a flat topography at the time.},

  abstract   = {Quantitative characterization of subsurface properties is critical for many environmental applications and serves as the basis to simulate and better understand dynamic subsurface processes. Geophysical imaging methods allow to image subsurface property distributions and monitor their spatio-temporal changes in a minimally invasive manner. While it is widely agreed upon that models integrating multiple independent data sources are more reliable, the number of approaches to do so is increasing rapidly and often overwhelming for researchers and, particularly, novices to the field. With this work, we aim to contribute to the development multimethod imaging through (1) an overview of, and didactic introduction to, existing inversion approaches for the integration of multiple geophysical data sets with other measurement types (e.g., hydrological observations), petrophysical models, and process simulations, (2) a state-of-the-art review on the use and potentials of these approaches in various environmental applications, and (3) a discussion on new frontiers and remaining challenges in the field. We hope that this chapter provides an entry point to recent developments in multimethod geophysical imaging, clarifies similarities, differences, and development potentials of existing approaches, and ultimately helps practitioners to choose the optimum one to integrate their data sets.}

abstract = {Abstract Geophysics provides a multidimensional suite of investigative methods that are transforming our ability to see into the very fabric of the subsurface environment, and monitor the dynamics of its fluids and the biogeochemical reactions that occur within it. Here we document how geophysical methods have emerged as valuable tools for investigating shallow subsurface processes over the past two decades and offer a vision for future developments relevant to hydrology and also ecosystem science. The field of “hydrogeophysics” arose in the late 1990s, prompted, in part, by the wealth of studies on stochastic subsurface hydrology that argued for better field-based investigative techniques. These new hydrogeophysical approaches benefited from the emergence of practical and robust data inversion techniques, in many cases with a view to quantify shallow subsurface heterogeneity and the associated dynamics of subsurface fluids. Furthermore, the need for quantitative characterization stimulated a wealth of new investigations into petrophysical relationships that link hydrologically relevant properties to measurable geophysical parameters. Development of time-lapse approaches provided a new suite of tools for hydrological investigation, enhanced further with the realization that some geophysical properties may be sensitive to biogeochemical transformations in the subsurface environment, thus opening up the new field of “biogeophysics.” Early hydrogeophysical studies often concentrated on relatively small “plot-scale” experiments. More recently, however, the translation to larger-scale characterization has been the focus of a number of studies. Geophysical technologies continue to develop, driven, in part, by the increasing need to understand and quantify key processes controlling sustainable water resources and ecosystem services.},
